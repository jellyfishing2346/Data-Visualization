# Data-Visualization

[Tutorial](https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/chartjs-charts-to-get-you-started/)

Display 2 types of charts (Suggested Doughnut chart & Horizontal bar chart, but if you find it useful to use another type, feel free) for some values in a dataset.
  * Find or make up a simple dataset of your own, and use [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) to visualize the data.
  * If you need ideas on what to list, you can find sample data sets from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/). However they are large, so only list the top 10 values (or get ideas to make up your own data).

Please list your name in the chart text portition of the data.
